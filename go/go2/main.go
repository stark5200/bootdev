/*
EARLY RETURNS
Go supports the ability to return early from a function. This is a powerful feature that can clean up code, especially when used as guard clauses.

Guard Clauses leverage the ability to return early from a function (or continue through a loop) to make nested conditionals one-dimensional. Instead of using if/else chains, we just return early from the function at the end of each conditional block.

/*
Error handling in Go naturally encourages developers to make use of guard clauses. When I started writing more JavaScript, I was disappointed to see how many nested conditionals existed in the code I was working on.

Letâ€™s take a look at an exaggerated example of nested conditional logic:
